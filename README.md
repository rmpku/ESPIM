# An Efficient and Stable Ptychographic Imaging Method

IWH2018-International Workshop on Holography and Related Technologies 

**Abstract**

Ptychography is a lensless coherent imaging technique that leverages various advantages observed in
other lensless coherent imaging methods, such as digital holography. These advantages include high
phase sensitivity, non-contact, non-destructive imaging, wide field of view, and diffraction-limited
optical resolution. The ptychography imaging approach involves obtaining a series of overlapping
diffraction patterns by changing the relative positions of the illumination beam and the sample, enabling
the reconstruction of the sample's complex amplitude distribution. This paper presents a novel approach
utilizing a highly integrated optical cage structure, an electronically controlled mobile platform, and
computer control to facilitate the instrumentation of ptychography imaging
